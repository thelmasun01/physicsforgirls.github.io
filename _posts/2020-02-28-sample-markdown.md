    <strong>4-Year's history</strong>
    <p>Physics can initially seem quite challenging and intimidating, which often deters students from engaging with it. Yet, physics forms the foundation of all scientific disciplines, making it an essential subject. In light of the persistent stereotypes surrounding women in STEM, my objective is to empower girls to break through these barriers and discover the exciting aspects of physics.</p>
    <p>This workshop is offered free of charge and includes introductory mini-lessons on mechanics (covering both dynamics and kinematics), practical labs, guest speakers, and much more. We can accommodate up to 20 participants on a first-come, first-served basis, so be sure to register early! The sessions will run from August 7 to August 11, between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM at Ferguson Township Elementary School. Additional details will be provided once the class roster is finalized. The deadline for registration is July 30th.</p>
    <p>If you have further questions, please email me at <a href="mailto:thelmasun01@gmail.com">thelmasun01@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Hope to see you there!</p>
